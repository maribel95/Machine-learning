# Machine-learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows a system to learn and improve autonomously using neural networks and deep learning, without having to be explicitly programmed, through the ingestion of large amounts of data.

Two projects involving different approaches to solving machine learning problems have been carried out.
